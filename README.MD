Goes into the directory which u provide
searches for the biggest file(size)
copys the file
and pastes it in a different directory

To improve this:
maybe using the threads module you can make the for loop run faster for bigger files
but for smaller files like .txt this works just fine without the threads file




Note:this does not work by copy pasting the code and running it 
you have to edit the path

Disclaimer:Do not use it for any dumb purposes against your or someone elses permission as it may cause your hardrive to fill up 
(in other words dont use it as it may cause ur harddrive to run out of space , and your harddrive may be slow later onwards)
